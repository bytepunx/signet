# S-0034 Concurrent flai test runs in one worktree corrupt client-elixir/deps, so later runs fail in mix compile

## Goal

This story remediates [I-0012](../../../design/issues/I-0012-concurrent-flai-test-runs-in-one-worktree-corrupt-client-elixir-deps-so-later.md), "Concurrent flai test runs in one worktree corrupt client-elixir/deps, so later runs fail in mix compile". The issue recommends no solution yet: propose one from its instances before building it.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The cause I-0012 describes no longer occurs, with a test that reproduces it where one fits
- [ ] I-0012 is closed with `flai issue close I-0012 --reason` saying what fixed it

## Tasks

## Notes

Cost of delay inputs set by flai from I-0012. time_lost_per_cycle 10m: 10m per occurrence × 1 occurrence ÷ 1 cycle of 168h (first reported 2026-11-06T08:34:44Z, 0 days before this story; under one cycle counts as one).
